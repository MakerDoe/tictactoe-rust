# Tic-Tac-Toe
Here is my version of the game Tic-Tac-Toe written in Rust. As part of this project, I made a strong Tic-Tac-Toe game with a tough AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm. Similar to other board gameÂ applications, this project uses advanced methods, such as bitboards, to quickly describe the game board.

You can play either against AI or against a real other person. The AI opponent will be very tough because it will use Minimax-powered logic to trick you.

Build the Rust program in release mode using `cargo build --release`. This command compiles the code with optimizations for better performance.

Once the build process is complete, navigate to the `target/release` directory within your project folder. In the `target/release` directory, you will find the compiled executable file. Run the Tic-Tac-Toe program by executing the binary file. For example, if the executable is named `tic_tac_toe`, run it using `./tic_tac_toe`.

Feel free to explore the source code, learn about the Minimax algorithm, and bitboard representations. I hope you enjoy playing this Rust Tic-Tac-Toe game as much as I enjoyed creating it. Happy gaming!
